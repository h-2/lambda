## Version 0.4.0 [2014/11/07]

### performance changes in comparison to published version (0.2)
 * new default mode with 30-80% speed gains and up to 75% memory reduction over published version
 * double-indexing mode with speed gains > 100%
 * sensitivity slightly increased at the same time (1-2%)

### changes in command line interface
 * renamed many parameters and changed some defaults
 * please look at `lambda --help` to see all the changes!!
 * better control of verbosity with `-v` parameter
 * threads now controlled with `-t` instead of environment variable

### new features
 * BlastN mode now usable again and proper parameter-handling added for it
 * added percent identity cutoff in addition to e-value cutoff (`-id`)
 * added a limit for maximum number of matches per query sequence (`-nm`)
 * added abundancy heuristic (`-pa`) and priorization of hits to not look at all hits if number of hits >> chosen limit
 * single-indexing mode which has huge memory advantages (`-qi none`) [now default]
 * FM-Index is now also default
 * removed Lambda-Alphabets, since they currently provide little benefit over Murphy10

### bug-fixes and minor changes
 * indeces with different settings (index type, alphabet) can now be created on the same fasta file without conflicts between them
 * changed pre-scoring heuristic to include region around match (`-ps` and `-pt`)
 * fixed build issues with gcc-4.8.x
 * FastQ support fixed

 * experimental support for FM-index as index (instead of SA) [not widely tested, yet]
