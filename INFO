Description: NCBI-Blast compatible local aligner that is very fast.
 LAMBDA: the Local Aligner for Massive Biological DatA is a fast local
 aligner optimized for NGS data and protein searches, but it also works on
 DNA-DNA searches. It is faster than most of its competitors while still being
 rather sensitive.
